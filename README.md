 Student Management System â€“ C++ OOP Project

This repository contains an object-oriented implementation of a Student Management System developed using C++. The project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of core OOP principles such as encapsulation, constructors (default, parameterized, copy), destructors, and data abstraction.
Features:-

Student Class: Stores essential student details including name, roll number, CGPA, and enrolled courses. It includes methods for adding courses, updating CGPA, and displaying student information, along with input validation (e.g., CGPA range).
StudentManagementSystem Class: Manages a collection of students. It provides functionality to add new student records, search by roll number, and display all records.
Error Handling: Includes basic validation for user inputs to ensure data integrity.
* **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean structure with separation of concerns, making it easy to extend and maintain.
This system is ideal for academic institutions to maintain and track student academic performance and course enrollment efficiently.
